### Who We Are 🌟
At [Some Engineering Inc.](https://some.engineering), our expertise lies in pioneering cloud security and infrastructure management solutions. We are dedicated to transforming the complexity of cloud environments into streamlined, user-friendly systems. Our goal is to empower businesses of various scales to manage and secure their cloud infrastructure with ease and efficiency.


### Our Product 🚀
- **[FIX](https://fix.security)**: Our latest offering in the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) space. FIX is designed to help organizations secure their cloud infrastructure efficiently. It comprises of these components:
  - [`fixinventory`](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory): Our established self-hosted cloud inventory tool, powering our SaaS offerings with reliability and flexibility. 🛠️ Fix Inventory is the backbone, facilitating resource management and optimization.
  - [`fixfrontend`](https://github.com/someengineering/fixfrontend): The FIX user interface for managing and monitoring your cloud security posture.
  - [`fixbackend`](https://github.com/someengineering/fixbackend): The backend that powers the FIX platform.
  - [`fix-cf`](https://github.com/someengineering/fix-cf): The sources for the AWS CloudFormation stack that FIX deploys.
  - [`fixcloudutils`](https://github.com/someengineering/fixcloudutils): Various utilities used in FIX.


### Open Source Commitment 💖
We believe in the power of open source. All our products are open source, inviting collaboration, innovation, and transparency. Fix Inventory is fully self contained and can be deployed on your laptop or in the cloud. We've invested heavily in its documentation, ensuring it is accessible and user-friendly for everyone. In contrast, FIX frontend and backend are distinctly designed projects. They are open source primarily for auditability and transparency. We actively develop these in the public domain, but they are specifically tailored to support our FIX SaaS system, and we frequently introduce breaking changes. It's also important to note that while FIX frontend is open source, it utilizes commercial Material UI components. As such, to use it, you'd need your own Material UI license.
